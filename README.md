MoodMirror 

MoodMirror is a calm, AI-inspired reflective web experience designed for moments when you simply want to feel heard.

Instead of productivity pressure or advice overload, MoodMirror responds to your current mood with gentle reflections and thoughtful words — creating a quiet space for emotional presence.

## Inspiration

MoodMirror was inspired by late-night thoughts, stressful days, and quiet moments where emotions often go unspoken.  
The goal was to build something small, intentional, and human — a project that focuses on *feeling* rather than fixing.
